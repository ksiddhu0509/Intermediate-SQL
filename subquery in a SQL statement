SQL subqueries are a standard feature available in most relational database management systems (RDBMS)

Suppose you have a database with two tables, "employees" and "departments," and you want to retrieve the names of employees in the "Sales" department. You can use a subquery like this:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table
WHERE column operator (SELECT column FROM another_table WHERE condition);

SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
