subquery in a SQL statement
A subquery, or nested query, is a query placed within another SQL query. When requesting information from a database, you may find it necessary to include a subquery into the SELECT, FROM , JOIN, or WHERE clause. However, you can also use subqueries when updating the database (i.e. in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements).

There are several types of SQL subqueries:

Scalar subqueries return a single value, or exactly one row and exactly one column.
Multirow subqueries return either:
One column with multiple rows (i.e. a list of values), or
Multiple columns with multiple rows (i.e. tables).
Correlated subqueries, where the inner query relies on information obtained from the outer query.

SQL subqueries are a standard feature available in most relational database management systems (RDBMS)

Suppose you have a database with two tables, "employees" and "departments," and you want to retrieve the names of employees in the "Sales" department. You can use a subquery like this:
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table
WHERE column operator (SELECT column FROM another_table WHERE condition);

SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
